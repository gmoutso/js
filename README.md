# js
javascripts that I find useful. They are not my own, but are in the public domain.

## email.js
It has been said that spam crawlers do not read javascript. A convenient way to hide email adresses is thus to encrypt them like this:

    <script>mail("gmoutso","gmail",0,"")

You must load the script in the header of your page like `<script src="email.js"></script>`. For an example of its use, see the page of contacts I wrote for the [NCTU string theory group](http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/~string/).

## Credit
If you recognize this code as yours, I will be happy to add your credit and/or link to your page.
