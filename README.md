# js
javascripts that I find useful. They are not my own, but are in the public domain.

## email.js
It has been said that spam crawlers do not read javascript. A convenient way to hide email adresses is thus to encrypt them like this:

    <script>mail("myusername","gmail",0,"")</script>

For an example of its use, see (http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/~string/).

## Credit
